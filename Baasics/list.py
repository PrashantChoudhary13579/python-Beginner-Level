# What is a List 
# It is a type of datatype where we can store mulitple things 

# List vs Array - fundamentally they are same
# 1.Array is homogeneous - same datatype 
# 1.List can be hetrogeneous - diff. datatype
# 2.In array, Data are stored in a continuous memory location , while it is not in list.
# 3.Array are faster then list
# 4.List are more programmer friendly
# 5.List are dynamic in nature, while array are static in nature.

# Create
l = []
print(l)
l = [1,2,3,4,5]
print(l)

l2 = ["Hello", 4,5,6,True,5+7j]
print(l2)

# Multi-dim lists
# 2D list
l3 = [1,2,3,[4,5,6]]
print(l3)
# example of heterogeneous

# 3D list
l4 = [[[1,2],[3,4]],[[5,6],[7,8]]]
print(l4)

l5 = list("Halldia")
print(l5)

l6 = list()
print(l6)

print(l2[4])
print(l2[5])
