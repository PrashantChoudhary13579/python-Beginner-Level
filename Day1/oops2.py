# Creating a data type 
x = 5/6
print(x)

# class mein do chij hoti h - data and uske function 
# If we want to access them it will be only possible if we make the object of the class 
# While accessing any of the data or the function that work can be easily done with the help of the object of the class as
# By using the dot operator - sbi.deposit(), sbi.withdraw() , sbi.amount(), hdfc.deposit(), hdfc.withdraw(), hdfc.exitint()

# This is done for basically 2 object if we have multiple objects then we will have a reference variable which changes it's object/value each time.

# Here comes *self* as that reference variable.

# self - this is the current object
